# saphire_0.0.1-1.19.2
3 times the charm
This repository is me attempting again for the 3rd time and I hope this goes better than the last :D So with that said,
I should start this off right by stating that I am just starting out in modding.  Something I have been interested in for some time.
Every since, I experienced my first mod, to the first time I experienced a multitude of mods in a pack.  Here recently I worked on
a project that hosted over 280 mods.  So everything here is experimental.  This project currently is currently codenamed "Saphire".
I hope in the near future I can learn more of java and the code therein. I do have some pretty big plans for the future.
